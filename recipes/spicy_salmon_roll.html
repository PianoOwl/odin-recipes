    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Spicy Salmon Rolls are so fun to make at home and if you're like me and my family and you are 
        severely missing going out for sushi, let me tell you - these will fix you right up! I am thrilled 
        to be bringing you another recipe in partnership with Kvarøy Arctic. If you missed it, 
        I created this Epic Bagel Brunch Board earlier this month and I'm still dreaming about it.</p>

     <h3>Directions:</h3>
     <ol>
        <li><h4>SUSHI RICE</h4></li>

        <li>Prepare rice by combining rice and water in sauce pan.</li>
        <li>Bring to a full boil, then reduce to lowest simmer, cover and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, turn off heat, crack lid, and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>

        <li><h4>SPICY MAYO</h4></li>

        <li>While rice is cooking, prepare rice seasoning by combining ingredients in a sauce pan, bring 
        to just below a boil, turn heat off and allow to sit and cool to room temp. Strain and discard kombu.</li>
        <li>When rice is at warm room temp and rice seasoning has cooled, combine them. I like to use a fork 
        so I don't mash up the rice too much. Just drizzle the seasoning around and fluff the rice with a fork as you go.</li>

        <li><h4>SPICY MAYO</h4></li>

        <li>Combine all spicy mayo ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine</li>
        <li>Place in fridge if not using right away</li>
        <li>If you want to be extra fancy, put some in a little squeeze bottle so you can feel like a real sushi chef!</li>

        <li><h4>SPICY SALMON FILLING</h4></li>

        Remove skin from fillet and discard or save for another use if you prefer.
        <li>Slice the salmon into long strips and then slice those strips into small cubes. 
        I prefer ¼ inch or so, but you can make them larger or smaller depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Place salmon in a mixing bowl, add remaining spicy salmon filling ingredients and stir to combine.
        Place in fridge if not using right away.</li>

        <li><h4>TO ASSEMBLE</h4></li>
        <li>Lay a sheet of nori on your bamboo mat with the dull side facing up. spread a thin layer of rice on the surface, 
        making sure to keep your finger tips moist so the rice doesn't stick.</li>
        <li>Next, place a small amount of filling in a thin strip from left to right on the side closest to you. 
        Place a few strips of cucumber on top, sprinkle with sesame seeds or furikake seasoning and roll away from you, 
        using the bamboo mat to help keep the roll nice and tight.</li>
        <li>Here is a helpful video: How to Roll Sushi</li>
        <li>Once it is rolled, place on a cutting board and slice into rounds. The ends might be a little messy, 
        but they are just as delicious.</li>
        <li>Place your pieces of sushi onto serving plate or board, drizzle with LOTS of spicy mayo, garnish with tobiko, 
        green onions, sesame seeds, furikake, and ENJOY!</li>
     </ol>
